**Dino Runner - Game Scripts**
Welcome to the repository for Dino Runner, a game I created my sophomore year of college to pass time on flights for my friends and I.
This repository contains the scripts that form the backbone of the game's functionality and interactivity.

**Overview**
The scripts in this repository are integral to the game's mechanics, including player movement, obstacle generation, score tracking, and game state management. 
They are written with clarity and efficiency in mind, providing a solid foundation for understanding the game's underlying logic.

**Configuration**
Please note that these scripts are designed to work within the Unity game development environment. To use these scripts:

**Unity Account:** Ensure you have a Unity account. If not, you can create one at Unity's official website.

**Project Setup:** Import these scripts into your Unity project. These files are configured to work with Unity, and direct execution outside this environment is not supported.

**Environment Configuration:** Before running these scripts, ensure your Unity project is properly set up and configured to your account. This step is crucial as the scripts rely
on Unity's ecosystem to function correctly.

**Usage**
The files in this repository serve as a showcase of the code implemented for "Dino Runner". They are provided as examples to demonstrate the programming techniques and logic used in the game's development. While these scripts are fully functional within a Unity environment, they require appropriate setup and configuration as mentioned above.

**Contributing**
While this repository primarily serves as a showcase, contributions are welcome. If you have suggestions for improvements or bug fixes, 
feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
